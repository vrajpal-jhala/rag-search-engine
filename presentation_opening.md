# Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
## Why Search Matters More Than You Think

---

# Quick Question

How many of you have used  
ChatGPT or Copilot  
in the last week?

---

# One More Question

How many of you  
**completely trust**  
the answers?

---

# The Real Problem

Imagine your company has:

- 8 years of documentation  
- Confluence pages  
- Slack threads  
- PDFs  
- PR discussions  
- Notion / Google Docs  

Now you ask:

> “What is our refund policy for enterprise customers in the EU?”

You don’t want the internet’s answer.  
You want **your company’s answer.**

# What Happens Today?

The model gives you:

- A confident answer  
- Clean formatting  
- Strong language  
- Possibly wrong information  

It might be:

- Outdated  
- Incomplete  
- Or completely fabricated  

And it won’t say  
“I don’t know.”

# This Is NOT an LLM Problem

It’s a **retrieval problem.**

---

# The Core Question

# How do we make LLMs  
# answer using  
# OUR knowledge?

---

# Enter: RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG is simply:

- Search  
- + Context  
- + Generation  

---

# But Here’s the Catch

If your **search is bad**  
your **RAG is bad.**

Before we talk about RAG…

We need to talk about  
**how search evolved.**
