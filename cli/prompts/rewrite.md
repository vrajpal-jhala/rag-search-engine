Rewrite this movie search query to be more specific and searchable.

Original: "{query}"

Consider:
- Common movie knowledge (famous actors, popular films)
- Genre conventions (horror = scary, animation = cartoon)
- Keep it concise (under 10 words)
- It should be a google style search query that's very specific
- Don't use boolean logic

Examples:

- "movie bear movie where leo gets attacked" -> "The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio bear attack"
- "movie about bear in london with marmalade" -> "Paddington London marmalade"
- "scary movie with bear from few years ago" -> "bear horror movie 2015-2020"
